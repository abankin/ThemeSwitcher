# Dark, Light mode switcher
A simple way for implementation theme switching (dark, light, system) into your application

The state storage in the example is implemented via User Defaults, but you can use any databases (Core Data, Realm and etc.)

In the system theme mode, the interface colors change automatically in real time along with the theme change on the device.

Images and colors for all themes can be prepared in Assets.xcassets:
